```



# Problem 2

For binary data, define a GLM using log link (define any notation you use). Show that the effects refer to the relative risk. Why do you think this link is not often used? (Hint: what happens if the linear predictor takes a positive value?)

# Problem 3

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(image_path, 'Problem 3 5.2 p1.png'))
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(image_path, 'Problem 3 5.2 p2.png'))
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(image_path, 'Problem 3 5.2 p3.png'))
```
